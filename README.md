# Skin Cancer Analyzer

This project is a Streamlit application designed to assist in the analysis of skin lesion images and predict the likelihood of different types of skin cancer. Leveraging a pre-trained image classification model from Hugging Face, specifically the "Anwarkh1/Skin\_Cancer-Image\_Classification" model, the application aims to provide insights into potential skin conditions, empowering users with information to facilitate informed discussions with healthcare professionals. The model was trained on a dataset of skin lesion images.

**Features:**

*   **Image Upload:** Allows users to upload images of skin lesions for analysis in common formats such as JPG, JPEG, and PNG.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Employs a sophisticated image classification model to assess the uploaded image and predict the probability of various skin cancer types.
*   **Probability Assessment:** Provides a detailed breakdown of the probabilities associated with each potential diagnosis, offering a comprehensive view of the model's assessment.
*   **Condition Information:** Displays human-readable information about the predicted skin condition, including key characteristics, common locations, and risk factors.

**Probabilities of Illnesses:**

The application provides probabilities for the following illnesses:

*   Melanoma
*   Basal Cell Carcinoma
*   Squamous Cell Carcinoma
*   Melanocytic Nevus
*   Actinic Keratosis
*   Seborrheic Keratosis
*   Dermatofibroma
*   Vascular Lesion
*   Pigmented Benign Keratosis
